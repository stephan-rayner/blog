<!-- ## üìù How to Rewrite a Git Commit with `rebase -i` -->

Ever make a commit and then immediately realize the message could be clearer or you typed ‚Äúfix‚Äù as ‚Äúfiz‚Äù? Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî Git has your back.

If the commit isn‚Äôt already pushed (or you're okay force-pushing), you can easily rename it using **interactive rebase**. Here‚Äôs how.

### Step 1: See your recent commits

First, check how far back the commit is:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Each line is a commit, with the most recent on top. Count how far back the one you want to rename is.

### Step 2: Start an interactive rebase

Use the number of commits you want to review. For example, if the commit is 3 commits ago:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

This will open a text editor with a list of commits.

### Step 3: Mark the commit to be renamed

Change the word `pick` to `reword` (or just `r`) next to the commit you want to rename:

```plaintext
reword a1b2c3d Fix typo in README
pick   d4e5f6g Add unit tests
pick   h7i8j9k Update CI config
```

Then save and close the file.

### Step 4: Edit the commit message

Git will now prompt you to enter a new message for the commit you marked. Type your updated message, save, and close the editor.

### Step 5: Done!

If there are no conflicts, your rebase will complete. If Git hits a conflict, it‚Äôll tell you what to do ‚Äî usually:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

### A Quick Word of Caution

If you‚Äôve already pushed the commit to a shared branch, renaming it will rewrite history. You‚Äôll need to force push:

```bash
git push --force

# or possibly

git push -f origin YOUR_GIT_BRANCH_HERE
```



Personally, I am fond of this method as it injects the name of the branch into the command at execution time.

```bash
git push -f origin $(git branch | grep '*' | tr -d '* [:space:]')
```

------

That‚Äôs it! Next time you typo your commit message or want to clean things up, interactive rebase is your friend.
