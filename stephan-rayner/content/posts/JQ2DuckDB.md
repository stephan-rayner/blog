## The Problem

Processing JSON Lines (JSONL) data on the command line has traditionally been done using JQ, but its specialized syntax and limited functionality can make complex data operations challenging. Many developers need a more powerful and intuitive tool for JSON processing tasks.

## A Solution

DuckDB provides a SQL-based alternative to JQ that offers better performance, familiar syntax, and more advanced features for processing JSONL data. Let's explore how DuckDB can replace JQ for common JSON processing tasks.

## How It Works

### Basic Setup

First, ensure you have DuckDB installed

```bash

# On macOS
brew install duckdb

# On Linux, Windows, or for you favourite programming language:
# Follow instructions here: https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/
```

### Sample Data

We'll use this example JSONL file (`data.jsonl`) throughout our examples:

```json

{"id": 1, "product": "Laptop", "price": 1200, "category": "Electronics", "in_stock": true}
{"id": 2, "product": "Mouse", "price": 25, "category": "Electronics", "in_stock": false}
{"id": 3, "product": "Desk Chair", "price": 150, "category": "Furniture", "in_stock": true}
{"id": 4, "product": "Coffee Mug", "price": 10, "category": "Kitchen", "in_stock": true}
```

### Common Operations

#### 1. Filtering Records

```sql

-- DuckDB
FROM read_json_auto('data.jsonl')
WHERE price > 100;

-- Equivalent JQ
cat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.price > 100)'
```

A minor thing I love about the SQL implementation in DuckDB, if you are writing `SELECT * FROM ...` you can drop the select and just use `FROM`.

#### 2. Aggregations

```sql

-- DuckDB
SELECT category, AVG(price) as avg_price 
FROM read_json_auto('data.jsonl') 
GROUP BY category;

-- Equivalent JQ
cat data.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, avg_price: (map(.price) | add / length)})'
```

#### 3. Data Transformations

```sql

-- DuckDB
SELECT 
    product as item, 
    ROUND(price * 1.2, 2) as cost 
FROM read_json_auto('data.jsonl') 
WHERE in_stock = true;

-- Equivalent JQ
cat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.in_stock == true) | {item: .product, cost: (.price * 1.2)}'
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Familiar SQL Syntax**: No need to learn a new query language if you already know SQL.
2. **Better Performance**: DuckDB's columnar storage and query optimization handle large datasets efficiently.
3. **Automatic Type Inference**: DuckDB correctly identifies and handles data types from JSON automatically.
4. **Advanced Features**: Easily perform complex operations like joins, window functions, and multi-source queries.
5. **Multiple File Types**: Easily work with CSV, JSON, JSONL, and Parquet all in one query and then write out to the format of your choosing.

## Example

I have two files `data.jsonl` and `data.csv` that contain inventory similar to above. I need to read both files and write the result into a GitLab issue comment. Fortunately GitLab (and GitHub for that matter) support markdown. Lets switch it up and use the `-c` flag that duckdb offers. Here is how to do it:

```shell
 duckdb -markdown -c "
  FROM 'data.jsonl'
  UNION ALL
  FROM 'data.csv'"

| id |  product   | price |   category    | in_stock |
|---:|------------|------:|---------------|---------:|
| 1  | Laptop     | 1200  | Electronics   | true     |
| 2  | Mouse      | 25    | Electronics   | false    |
| 3  | Desk Chair | 150   | Furniture     | true     |
| 4  | Coffee Mug | 10    | Kitchen       | true     |
| 5  | Keyboard   | 200   | Electronics   | true     |
| 6  | Mouse Pad  | 15    | Miscellaneous | false    |
| 7  | Office Rug | 250   | Furniture     | true     |
| 8  | Tea Pot    | 70    | Kitchen       | true     |
```

I did not include a JQ example because you honestly can't do this with JQ. I suppose if you really wanted to use JQ you could do the following:

- Use DuckDB to convert the CSV file into JSONL
- Use JQ to merge the JSONL files into one JSONL file
- Use DuckDB (or other tool) to output it as a Markdown table

But at this point just use DuckDB and save yourself some trouble.

## When to Use What

Use DuckDB when:

- Working with large JSONL, JSON, CSV, or Parquet datasets
- Performing complex data operations
- Combining multiple data sources of the same or different file types
- Need for SQL-based analysis

Use JQ when:

- Quick command-line JSON transformations
- Simple filtering operations
- Pretty Printed JSON output (I still use JQ daily for this)
- Shell script integration

## Summary

DuckDB offers a more powerful and intuitive alternative to JQ for processing JSONL data. Its SQL interface, superior performance, and advanced features make it an excellent choice for both simple and complex JSON data manipulation tasks. While JQ remains useful for quick transformations, DuckDB provides a more scalable and comprehensive solution for modern data processing needs.
