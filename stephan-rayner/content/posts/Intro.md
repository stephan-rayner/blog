## I've Been Lucky

Over the years, Iâ€™ve been incredibly fortunate to work alongside some excellent engineers. The opportunities I had early in my career to learn from these talented people shaped me into who I am today. Beyond their technical skills, their passion for what they were teaching made me rethink what it was to be a good engineer. I now believe that engineering (of all kinds) is a much more interpersonal discipline where knowledge sharing should be the principal indicator of a great engineer.

I recall a senior engineer at my first startup patiently working through the OAuth protocols v1 and v2 with me. I remember the sensation that I was seeing how part of the world really worked for the first time. That interaction left a lasting impression. It wasn't just about the technical details; it was about the excitement he felt in sharing something he admired. Passion can be infectious.

## Paying It Forward

Years later, Iâ€™ve realized just how much I enjoy sharing knowledge with other people. Thatâ€™s why I created this blog: to pay it forward. Here, Iâ€™ll share things Iâ€™ve picked up over the years, stuff I find fascinating, and maybe even the occasional recipe (because hey, we all have to eat).

One very recent and profoundly rewarding moment happened while I was in California giving a guest lecture. I was invited by the lecturer who was a friend and colleague that I had hired and mentored a few years prior. Seeing how this young graduate had grown into an intermediate full-stack engineer with a prestigious company while simultaneously becoming a lecturer at a private university, made me realize just how far being willing to share ideas can take all of us.

## We Are All Forgetful and Lazy

Iâ€™ll admit it, Iâ€™m forgetful. I always have been. Writing things down helps me remember them better, and sharing my thoughts forces me to organize them in a way that sticks. I first discovered this back in university when I started running study groups.

The beauty of writing things down is that now, one doesn't need to properly remember everything. I can just look it up later! Plus, if someone asks me a question that Iâ€™ve already written about, I can just send them a link so we can talk through the finer points at our own pace. 

But itâ€™s more than just convenience. Writing is also a way to process what we've learned. Sometimes, itâ€™s not until I sit down to explain a concept that I realize I donâ€™t fully understand it myself. In a way, writing isnâ€™t just for others itâ€™s for me, too.

## Why a Blog at All?

Honestly, this blog is as much for me as it is for anyone else. Writing things down helps me think more clearly, and sharing what Iâ€™ve learned feels like a natural way to give back.

That said, Iâ€™m not going to pretend Iâ€™m great at writing. Iâ€™ve always been better at articulating ideas in person or verbally. But I recognize that the nature of my work (and where the industry is headed) means that strong writing skills are more important than ever. So, Iâ€™m hoping that as a side benefit of this blog, I will improve.

If this happens to help someone just starting out in their career or spark an idea for someone else, thatâ€™s what a win would look like. Alternatively, maybe this will be just a fun way to keep track of my own thoughts and look back on them someday.

## Short but Sweet

Some future posts will be longer than this, some shorter, but this feels like a good place to stop for now. My hope is that youâ€™ll enjoy what I write, find something useful here, and maybe even feel inspired to share what you know with others.

And if nothing else, Iâ€™ll enjoy these posts. As anyone who knows me can tell you, most of my jokes are for my own amusement, so if these posts donâ€™t land, at least Iâ€™ll still get the odd chuckle or two. ðŸ˜€
