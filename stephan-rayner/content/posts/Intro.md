## I've Been Lucky

Over the years, Iâ€™ve been incredibly fortunate to work alongside some amazing engineers. The opportunities I had early in my career to learn from these talented people shaped me into the engineer I am today. Beyond their technical skills, their passion for whatever they were teaching lit a spark in meâ€”to pursue my own passions and see the world through a slightly different lens.

One moment that stands out was when a senior engineer patiently walked me through how HTTPS works. I remember being blown awayâ€”not just by the complexity of the protocol, but by how much care he put into explaining it in a way that made sense to me. That interaction left a lasting impression. It wasnâ€™t just about the technical details; it was about the excitement he felt in sharing something he loved.

It wasnâ€™t always technical stuff, either. Some of the most valuable lessons came from observing how my mentors navigated challenges, like balancing technical trade-offs in an event-sourced architecture or managing the human dynamics of a team. These experiences didnâ€™t just shape my careerâ€”they shaped how I think about solving problems in life.

## Paying It Forward

Years later, Iâ€™ve realized just how much I enjoy sharing what Iâ€™ve learned. Thatâ€™s why I created this blog: to pay it forward. Here, Iâ€™ll share things Iâ€™ve picked up over the years, stuff I find fascinating, and maybe even the occasional recipe (because hey, we all have to eat).

One of the most rewarding moments of my career happened recently, watching someone I mentored as an intern grow into a full-stack engineer with a prestigious company and a lecturer at a university in California. When we first started working together, he was brilliant but a little hesitant. Watching his confidence grow over time was like seeing a rocket ship take off. Itâ€™s moments like these that remind me why sharing knowledge is so fulfilling.

## Forgetful and Lazy

Iâ€™ll admit it, Iâ€™m forgetful. I always have been. Writing things down helps me remember them better, and sharing my thoughts forces me to organize them in a way that sticks. I first discovered this back in university when I started running study groups.

The beauty of writing things down is that now, I donâ€™t even need to properly remember everything. I can just look it up later! Plus, if someone asks me a question Iâ€™ve already written about, I can just send them a link. Itâ€™s efficient and gives me a chance to help with follow-ups.

But itâ€™s more than just convenience. Writing is also a way to process what Iâ€™ve learned. Sometimes, itâ€™s not until I sit down to explain a concept that I realize I donâ€™t fully understand it myself. In a way, writing isnâ€™t just for othersâ€”itâ€™s for me, too.

## Why a Blog at All?

Honestly, this blog is as much for me as it is for anyone else. Writing things down helps me think more clearly, and sharing what Iâ€™ve learned feels like a natural way to give back.

That said, Iâ€™m not going to pretend Iâ€™m great at writing. Iâ€™ve always been better at articulating ideas in person or verbally. But I recognize that the nature of my work (and where the industry is headed) means that strong writing skills are more important than ever. So, Iâ€™m hoping that as a side benefit of this blog, Iâ€™ll get better at it.

If this happens to help someone just starting out in their career or spark an idea for someone else, thatâ€™s what a win would look like. Alternatively, maybe this will be just a fun way to keep track of my own thoughts and look back on them someday.

## Short but Sweet

Some future posts will be longer than this, some shorter, but this feels like a good place to stop for now. My hope is that youâ€™ll enjoy what I write, find something useful here, and maybe even feel inspired to share what you know with others.

And if nothing else, Iâ€™ll enjoy these posts. As anyone who knows me can tell you, most of my jokes are for my own amusement anyway, so if these posts donâ€™t land, at least Iâ€™ll still like them. ðŸ˜€
