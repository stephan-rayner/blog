## I've Been Lucky

I have been profoundly fortunate to have some incredible people around me over the years. I wouldn't be the engineer I am today without some of the opportunities I had early on to work along side, and learn from some very capable engineers. Beyond that seeing their passion for whatever they were sharing really excited me to pursue my own passions and see some corner of the world a little different. This took all sorts of forms whether it was the intricacies of how a the https protocol works, the trade offs inherent to an event sourced architecture, or the social and psychological struggles that we all encounter when being or working with managers.

## Paying Things Forward

Some years later I have realized just how much I appreciate having the opportunity to share what I know with people. To that end I am have created this blog to pay things forward. This will also consist of things I find neat, things I've learned over the years, and maybe the odd recipe (you gotta eat right). I recently had the opportunity to watch someone I mentored as an intern who is now lecturing at a university in California when he is not working as a full stack engineer. The topic of my guest lecture will one day be a blog post for sure but the real thrill for me was seeing the rocket ship take off of his growth in the last year.

## Forgetful and Lazy

Atop of all of this, I am forgetful, I always have been, and taking the time to encapsulate my thoughts and share them has always made them stick better in my head. This is something I discoverd early on in university when I started forming study groups. The advantage of doing things this way is that now I don't have even properly remember the information as I can look it up later. Plus should I need to explain something to someone I have already written about I can send them a link and help with any follow up questions. 

## Short But Sweet, Goodbye

Some future posts will be longer than this, some may even be shorter but I think this is a good place to stop things. I hope you get a kick out of the things I decide to write about. I hope this blog helps you, I hope it inspires you to share what you know with others, and I hope you get to smile a little along the way. But ultimately, as anyone who knows me can tell you, most of my jokes are for my own amusement anyway so like those if of these posts don't land I know I'll still like them ðŸ˜€
